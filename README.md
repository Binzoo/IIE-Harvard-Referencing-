# .NET Core WPF Referencing Tool 📚

Simplify the referencing process with this tool developed during my time at Varsity College. Input a YouTube link, and the application will automatically fetch the necessary information, formatting it into the IIE Harvard referencing style.

## 📋 Prerequisites 

### 1. YouTube API Key
- Before using this application, you'll need a YouTube API key. 
- Follow the step-by-step guide on [HubSpot](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key) to obtain one.

### 2. Visual Studio 
- To run and potentially modify the app, ensure you have Visual Studio installed on your machine.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage 

### 1. API Key Configuration
- With your YouTube API key at hand, locate the `YouTube.cs` class in the project.
- Within this class, find the appropriate variable to insert your API key.

### 2. Running the Application 
- Launch the project within Visual Studio.
- Build and execute the solution to kick off the application.
